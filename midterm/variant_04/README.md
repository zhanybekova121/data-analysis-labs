# Variant 04. Restaurant Performance Analysis
You are a data analyst for a company operating in the **Restaurant Performance** domain in Kyrgyzstan. Management needs an evidence-based report to support decisions. All monetary amounts are in KGS. Each row represents one record; the ID column identifies it. Data are synthetic.

## Dataset files
- `04_restaurant_raw.csv` — main dataset, 840 rows, 12 columns, with intentional data quality problems.
- `04_restaurant_lookup.csv` — reference table; merge key: `Meal Type`.

Key columns: `Meal Type` (merge key), `Unit Price` (main monetary indicator), `Quantity` (quantity-type column, stored as text), `Order Date` (mixed date formats), `Branch` (location).

## Data quality notes
- `Quantity` is stored as text but must be numeric.
- `Meal Type` contains inconsistent entries: different letter cases and leading/trailing spaces.
- Some `Meal Type` values are missing; some name values are recorded as "N/A".
- `Order Date` uses mixed date formats (YYYY-MM-DD and DD.MM.YYYY).
- `Unit Price` contains several extreme outliers.
- Column names and order are inconvenient and must be corrected.
- Missing values cannot always be reliably inferred; justify every decision.

## General instructions
Work individually. Use only NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib methods covered during the course. Preserve the original raw files. Explain every cleaning and analytical decision in Markdown. Interpret every result in business terms. Submit one Jupyter Notebook, both original CSV files and `cleaned_data.csv`. Run the notebook from start to finish before submission.

## TASK 1. Initial Data Exploration
Load `04_restaurant_raw.csv` and `04_restaurant_lookup.csv` with `pd.read_csv()`.

1. Report the number of rows and columns using `.shape`.
2. Display the first 10 rows using `.head(10)`.
3. Examine column names and data types using `.info()`.
4. Investigate unique values of `Meal Type` and `Payment Method` to find inconsistent entries.
5. Identify missing values in every column using `.isna().sum()`.
6. Identify duplicate records using `.duplicated().sum()` and show several examples.
7. Separate numerical and categorical variables, then describe all identified data quality problems in Markdown with examples.

## TASK 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. Handle missing values using an appropriate covered method. Justify your choice; do not invent values.
2. Standardize inconsistent values in `Meal Type`: trim spaces, unify letter case, and merge equivalent names (for example, IT / it / ИТ / Информационные технологии, if present). Document your mapping.
3. Remove duplicate records with `drop_duplicates()` and report how many rows were removed.
4. Identify outliers in `Unit Price` using a simple covered approach. State your threshold, report how many values were treated, and justify your decision.
5. Convert `Quantity` from text to a numeric type using `astype()`.
6. Convert `Order Date` to datetime with `pd.to_datetime()`. The column uses mixed formats; handle them correctly and explain how.
7. Rename `Unit Price` (and any other inconvenient column names) using consistent naming conventions, then reorder columns logically.
8. Merge the lookup dataset `04_restaurant_lookup.csv` with the main dataset on `Meal Type` using the combining method studied in class. Preserve all main records, explain your merge type, and report unmatched categories.
9. Check the cleaned dataset for remaining problems and save it as `cleaned_data.csv` with `to_csv(index=False)`.

## TASK 3. NumPy Practical Application

### 3.1 Array creation and conversion
Convert `Quantity` and `Unit Price` into NumPy arrays with `np.array()`. Report `.shape`, `.ndim`, `.size` and `.dtype` for both. Create a third array of 6 scenario coefficients using `np.linspace()` from 0.8 to 1.2. Explain the difference between a list and a NumPy array.

### 3.2 Indexing and slicing
From the `Unit Price` array extract the first eight values by slicing and elements at even positions using a step (`arr[:8]`, `arr[::2]`). Explain what each operation returns and how indexing differs from slicing.

### 3.3 Vectorization
Without Python loops, calculate the business metric: **net value = (Quantity × Unit Price) − Tip Amount** (`net = qty_arr * price_arr - extra_arr`). State the units of the result and interpret what it means for one record in the Restaurant Performance scenario. Explain why this vectorized operation is faster than a `for` loop (performance optimization).

### 3.4 Broadcasting
Take the first 6 values of your calculated metric as an array of shape (6, 1). Multiply it by a coefficient array of shape (3,) with values 0.90, 1.00, 1.10 using broadcasting. Explain why shapes (6, 1) and (3,) are compatible, what each resulting column means, and how broadcasting differs from element-wise multiplication of two same-shape arrays.

### 3.5 Boolean indexing
Using NumPy boolean indexing, select records where `Unit Price` is at least 3000 KGS AND NOT (`Quantity` is above 25). Use the `&` with `~` operator(s). Report how many records match and their total metric value. Interpret the result for management.

### 3.6 Statistical calculations and aggregation along axes
For your broadcasting result matrix, compute row means with `mean(axis=1)` and column standard deviations with `std(axis=0)`; explain both axes. Then calculate variance, standard deviation and range using `np.var`, `np.std`, max-minus-min. Do not add values with different units. Interpret one result in the business context.

### 3.7 Performance optimization
Explain in Markdown why vectorized NumPy operations are faster than Python `for` loops, using concepts covered in class.
## TASK 4. Business-Oriented Data Analysis
Answer each question with Pandas code and a short business interpretation. Use only methods covered during the course.

1. **Reshape to long.** Using `groupby()` and `agg()`, build a `Branch`-by-`Meal Type` table of total `Unit Price`; convert it to long format with `melt()` and identify the strongest combination.
2. **Pivot comparison.** Using `pivot_table()` with `values="Unit Price"`, `index="Meal Type"`, `columns="Payment Method"`, `aggfunc="sum"` and `fill_value=0`, compare category performance by payment type.
3. **Descriptive statistics.** Using `describe()` and `agg()`, report total, mean, median and standard deviation of `Unit Price`. Which statistic better represents the typical record and why?
4. **Top and bottom.** Using `nlargest(3, "Unit Price")` and `nsmallest(3, "Unit Price")`, compare the extreme records and interpret the gap.
5. **Ranking.** Using `groupby()` and `rank(method="average")`, rank `Unit Price` within each `Branch` and find the top 3 per Branch.
## TASK 5. Business Interpretation
In Markdown cells:
1. Identify **three** important business patterns supported by your calculations.
2. Compare key indicators between `Branch` and `Meal Type` groups; identify the strongest and weakest areas.
3. Give **1-2 practical recommendations** to management, supported by specific numbers from your analysis.

## Matplotlib Visualization Requirements
Create exactly five visualizations using Matplotlib. Each chart must have a title, axis labels where applicable, and a short interpretation.

1. **Grouped Bar:** Grouped bar chart of total Unit Price by `Branch` for the two largest `Meal Type` values. Insight: category performance differs by Branch.
2. **Line:** Line chart of total Unit Price by month, grouping `Order Date` by month with covered Pandas grouping. Insight: the trend over time.
3. **Hist:** Histogram of Unit Price per record. Insight: typical value and skewness.
4. **Box:** Box plot of Unit Price by `Meal Type`. Insight: differences in spread and outliers between categories.
5. **Bar:** Bar chart of total Unit Price by `Branch`. Insight: which Branch leads.
